# Pong-in-Java
School project - Pong game in which the user can play against the computer

Hello! In this repository, you will find the source code for a simple Pong game that I developped throughout my first Semester
at McGill University with the help of professor Frank Ferrie and T.A. Katrina Poulin. This project was for my Introduction to 
Software development course, in which I mainly learned Java and a little bit of C.
